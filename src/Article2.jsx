                1 x Infinity Formula: Same Principles Applied in Different Fields
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you are good at one thing, becoming good at everything is easy. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               The <b>1 x Infinity formula</b> or simply the <b>Creativity formula</b> is a simple and easy to apply learning technique that I have adopted and made part and parcel in my life when it comes to self improvement. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It entails understanding interests, strengths and habits and using this understanding to stimulate growth and mastery not only in one aspect but in every aspect of your life that you would wish to become great at. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This method is as a result of self reflection, experimentation and creativity itself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What led me to come up with this formula is my deep interest in several seemingly unrelated fields. They impacted my life significantly and I would be broken if I let go any of them to specialize in another. 
            </p>
           
            <p>
                I wanted to gain solid expertise in all these fields, but, again, they all seemed so unrelated. How was I going to achieve mastery doing several random things all at once?
            </p>
            <p>
                I was stuck in a dilemma. To either let go of almost all my interest and things I really cared about and go into fields that I barely had interested in just because they were 'related', or follow my intuition.
            </p>
            <p>
               KNowing that I could not live with myself if I chose the first option, this is when the creativity formula was birthed. 
            </p>
