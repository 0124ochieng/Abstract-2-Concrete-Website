                 The Skills you are Currently Learning vs What the Market needs    
            </h2> 
            <br/><br/>
            <p>
                <b>The best learning strategy is to learn skills that are needed in the market.</b>
            </p>
            <p>What you are currently learning may be irrelevant.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                You have been surfing through the internet in search of information about what to study and what skills you need to acquire in order to stay competitive.
                You may have been engaging with articles, social media tweets, content creators and even random people who share the same interest as yourself, in search of credible information.
                <br/> <br/>
                The internet is a great place to start, because you can find a ton of information mostly for free. However, this information may not be applicable to everyone including you.
                <br/> <br/>
                After completing universty, I knew I had to diversify my portfolio. I dedicated four months to learn soft skills and tech skills which I would then use to craft my career. So I rushed online, watched YouTube videos, followed trending content creators, read articles and many other things to determine what I should do and how. 
                <br/> <br/>
                I started learning web development. I thought that once I had a solid understanding, it will be easier to navigate my way up the career field. I spent 4 months, living on my savings with the hopes of huge returns. 
                I was determined to learn. My mentors (the so-called experts that I was following), had told me of how insanely profitable this career may be. I rushed, without putting much thought into it. 
                <br/> <br/>
                Fast-forward, four months later, my skills are quite amazing, however, I was not making any income. My confidence was shaken.
                <br/> <br/>
                I did not have the social media following to market my skills to a global audience, I did not know of any business owners who would hire my talents and here is the crazy part, in as much as I was a good developer, my skills were barely enough to make me as competitive as I thought I would have become by this time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What I learned is that it is not always a guarantee that every single strategy you find online will definately apply to you. There are several factors that determine whether they will work or not. They include:
            </p>   
                <ul>
                    <li>Personality</li>
                    <li>Geographic location</li>
                    <li>Social networks</li>
                </ul>
                <b>This is what I learned from my experience: </b>
            
            
                <h5>'Good skills' does not guarantee market</h5>
            <p>    
            The essence of learning a skill is to <b>deliver value</b>. Whether your aim may is to start a business or land a job, you have to deliver value to someone. This factor is paramount. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The 'online-experts' had suggested how profitable web development is, and so I rushed with an aim to learn it, jump into the market and make big bucks. They were right, it is profitable but in the long term. 
                I did not have the time to wait for long term. I needed money asap. 
            </p>
                <p>
                    Four months down the line, I was not making a single dime. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mistake that I made was not determining before hand <b>how I could reach potential clients </b>and sell my services. I thought that since everyone was learning web development, it had to be profitable and so it was definitely going to be a great opportunity for me too. 
                </p>
                <p>Learning a skill is one thing, but getting access to clients is another chapter of its own. Being good at a skill will not draw clients to you, what will draw clients to you is self marketing and advertising, your skill will only solidify your relationship with them.   
                </p>

                <p>The common YouTubers' teachings are generalized. They barely go into the details about the entire process of turning a goal into reality. They only tell you where you should start if you want to have a certain outcome. None of them talks about the actual steps(which are dificult), you need to take. Because if they did, many people would be discouraged from the word go and even end up dropping out of their courses.They only talk much about the positive aspects, not the struggle and hustle of actually achieving the tiny little milestones that make up the entire journey. So since they never get into the details, it is easy to imagine that achieving success is as easy as they say it is.</p>
                <p>
                    That was my mistake. I went on social platforms to find gigs. I did not find one. I needed a good number of followers or influence to actually market and monetize. I had 0 followers. Online approach certainly was not a viable approach at the moment.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I went to the streets, this is where the real learning started. 
                    First, I discovered two things. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I had studied a lot, but knew nothing.</li>
                    <li>The market had different needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2. What the market is and what it really wants</h4>
                <p>
                    Money revolves in and out of businesses. This is where you find the largest volume of money circulating. This is why people are drawn to these places. Eventually, they either give their money to or receive money from the business. I like to think of businesses as a hotspot for money.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But there is a reason though. What draws them to these places? </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Value.</b>
                 </p> 

                 <p>
                    Businesses mainly focus on solving the problems their clients are facing. That means that they will sell goods or services which satisfy the demands of their market. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    To deliver such value they will hire personnel whose skills/expertise are able to meet these demands. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    In other occassions, the business may hire individuals whose expertise will not serve the clients directly, but will serve in boosting the company's capacity or reach, putting it in a better position of addressing the needs of their clients. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    If customers don't mind going online and purchasing products from a company's website, then the company won't mind investing resources to hire web developers. However, if the customers prefer the traditional shopping method, then a website won't be necessary and so, the company may not invest resources in such a venture, make sense? 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    This is where the idea of geographic location comes to play. 
                    Most businesses, ones that I can reach physically, prefer conducting businesses the traditional way. They do face challenges, want more customers but owning a website has never been on top of their priority list. 
                    They are more preoccupied with filing their taxes, renewing business licences, earning customer trust  and loyalty. The internet space has never been a option for them; dictated by the buying prefernces of their clients. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    So in my case, I had skills. The problem however, is that the market that I was targeting was not ready for what I had to offer, yet.  
                 </p>
                 
                 <h4>Lessons learnt</h4>
                 <p>
                    A YouTube mentor will tell you what you need to know for the start but the vendor at your local grocery shop has the knowlegde that you need to stay on track. 
                    I can summarize and say that 10,000 videos on YouTube won't give you a day's worth of real experience.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    First, determine the market, its demand and a way of reaching them then pursue a skill. My mistake was that I went the other way round. Studying a skill before I understood the market. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Use feedback as a way to make informed learning approaches. 
                    Reach out to prospective employers or clients, ask whether what you are currently Studying is a skill that they would hire. Also inquire for other related fields which they would wish to explore but currently lack the expertise. 
                 </p>
