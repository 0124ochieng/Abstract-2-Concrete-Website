                <b>The best learning strategy is to learn skills that are needed in the market.</b>

            <p>What you are currently learning may be irrelevant.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                You have been surfing through the internet in search of information about what to study and what skills you need to acquire in order to stay competitive.
                You may have been engaging with articles, social media tweets, content creators and even random people who share the same interest as yourself, in search of credible information.
                <br/> <br/>
                The internet is a great place to start, because you can find a ton of information mostly for free. However, this information may not be applicable to everyone.
                <br/> <br/>
                After completing universty, I knew I had to diversify my portfolio. I set out to take four months to gain both soft skills and tech skills which I would then use to craft my career. So I rushed online, watched YouTube videos, followed prominent content creators, read articles and many other things to determine what I should do and how. 
                <br/> <br/>
                I started learning web development. I figured out that once I had a solid understanding, it will be easier to navigate my way up the career field. I spent 4 months, living on my savings with the hopes of huge returns 4 months later. 
                I was determined to learn. My mentors (the so-called experts that I was following), had told me of how insanely profitable this career may be. I rushed, without putting much thought into it. 
                <br/> <br/>
                Fast-forward, four months later, my skills are pretty amazing, however, I was not making any income. My confidence was shaken.
                <br/> <br/>
                I did not have the social media following to market my skills to a global audience, I did not know of any business owners who would hire my talents and here is the crazy part, in as much as I was a good developer, my skills were barely enough to make me as competitive as I thought I would have become by this time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What I learned is that it is not always a guarantee that every single strategy you find online will definately apply to you. There are several factors that determine whether they will work or not. They include:
            </p>   
                <ul>
                    <li>Personality</li>
                    <li>Geographic location</li>
                    <li>Social networks</li>
                </ul>
                <b>This is what I learned from my experience: </b>
            
            
                <h5>1. Know your potential client</h5>
            <p>    
                The most important factor to determine before you embark on a journey of personal learning, is your potential client. The essence of learning a skill is to <b>deliver value</b>. Whether your aim may is to start business or land an employment, you have to deliver value to someone. This factor is paramount. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will not talk about, how to determine the interests, needs and pain points of your potential client because these factors have already been over-emphasized by other creators and writers. Let us talk about another factor, one that has often been overlooked, <b>access to your clients</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 'online-experts' had suggested how profitable web development is, and so I rushed with an aim to learn it, jump into the market and make big bucks. They were right, it is profitable but in the long term. 
                I did not have the time to wait for long term. I needed money asap. 
            </p>
                <p>
                    Four months down the line, I was not making a single dime. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mistake that I made was not determining before hand how I could reach potential clients and sell my services. I thought that since everyone was learning web development, it had to be profitable and so it was definitely going to be a great opportunity for me too. 
                </p>
                <p>Take an example of a YouTuber who has courses on self development and personal growth, their message being gaining skills and using them to change your life. Their teachings are generalized. They barely go into the details about the entire process of turning a goal into reality. They only tell you where you should start if you want to have a certain outcome. None of them talks about the actual steps(which are dificult), you need to take. Because if they did, many people would be discouraged from the word go and even end up dropping out of their courses.They only talk much about the positive aspects, not the struggle and hustle of actually achieving the tiny little milestones that make up the entire journey. So since they never get into the details, it is easy to imagine that achieving success is as easy as they say it is.</p>
                <p>
                    That was my mistake. I went online and searched for means of getting a market or a gig. I did not find one. I needed a good number of followers to actually market and monetize. I had 0 followers. Online approach certainly was not the best approach at the moment.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I went to the streets, this is where the real learning started. 
                    First, I discovered two things. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The market had different needs.</li>
                    <li>I had studied a lot, but knew nothing.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What the market is</h4>
                <p>
                    Money revolves in and out of businesses. This is where you find that largest volume of money circulating. This is why people are drawn to these places. Eventually, they either give their money to or receive money from the business. I like to think of businesses as a hotspot for money.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But there is a reason though. What draws them to these places? </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Value.</b> It is simply the exchange. 
                 </p> 
                 <p>
                     What dictates this value? 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <b>Problems.</b>
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <i>Value,</i> is the reason why I was not making any income from the skills I had learnt. 
                    Why? The business people around my geographic location provided certain services to certain types of clients.
