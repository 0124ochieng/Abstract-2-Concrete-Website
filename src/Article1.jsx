                You have been surfing through the internet or social media in search of information about what to study and what skills you need to acquire in order to stay competitive.
                You may have been engaging with tweets on social media from experts, content creators and even random people who seem to share the same interest as yourself, articles, e.t.c in search of credible information.
                <br/> <br/>
                The internet is a great place to start, because you can find a ton of information mostly for free. However, the only problem is that all these sources are from very random people who have very different mindsets and may not even be in the same geographic location as their followers and so the strategies they often teach may not be applicable to evey individual.

                After completing universty, I knew I had to diversify my portfolio. I set out to take four months to gain both soft skills and tech skills which I would then use to craft my career. So I rushed online, watched YouTube videos, followed prominent content creators, read articles and many other things to determine what I beed to do and how. 
                <br/> <br/>
                So I started learning web development. I figured out that once I have a solid understanding, it will be easier to navigate my way up the career field. So I spent 4 months, living on my savings with the hopes of huge returns 4 moths later. 
                I was determined to learn. My mentors, (the so-called experts that I was following), had told me of how insanely profitable this career may be. I rushed, without putting much thought into it. 
                <br/> <br/>
                Fast-forward, four months later, my skills are pretty amazing, but then boom, how was I going to make an income? My confidence was shaken.
                <br/> <br/>
                I did not have the social media following where I could market my skills to a global audience, I did not know of any business owners who would hire my talents and here is the crazy part, in as much as I was a good developer, my skills were barely enough to make me as competitive as I thought I would have become by this time.

                It is not always a guarantee that every single strategy to find online will definately apply to you. This is because there are several factors that determine whether they work or not. For example;
                <ul>
                    <li>Personality</li>
                    <li>Geographic location</li>
                    <li>Social networks</li>
                </ul>
